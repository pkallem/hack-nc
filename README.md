# AgTech

## Inspiration
The health of soil and its quality have been rapidly declining globally in recent years. The fact that farmers and producers lack information on the crops is one problem that makes this issue worse. Data on soil quality such as moisture and temperature can play a big part in combating climate change and landscape degradation. If properly maintained soil stores carbon, lowering greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. If soils are poorly maintained or cultivated using unsustainable agricultural methods, soil carbon may be released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, which can further climate change, negatively impacting the environment and farmers alike.

## What it does
AgTech measures 5 important aspects: Temperature, Humidity, Heat index, Water level and Object detection. 

## How we built it
AgTech is built with HTML, CSS, Json, and React. 

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge that we faced was the time constraint! 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As we went on with the project we kept adding ideas and implementing them into the project. Our website was one of our greatest accomplishments as we add little features to increase the aesthetic through formatting and gifs. 

## What we learned
Our team gained a great deal of insight into our individual strengths and shortcomings.
We were all brought together by our preparation and communication. We all played to our strengths as some of us were more versed in HTML while others with Arduino 

## What's next for AgTech 
Moving forward with AgTech, we would like to create personalized pages for agriculture businesses and farmers, provide precise feedback and recommendations for future planning based on the gathered analytics, as well as assist farmers with automation process

## Built With
HTML, CSS, Json, Firebase and React.
