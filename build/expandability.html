      <ul class="goals">
        <li>
          Hydrological, biological, and biogeochemical processes can all be
          impacted by the ability to measure soil moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
          The amount of precipitation that drains into the neighboring streams
          and rivers is also greatly influenced by the moisture of the soil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Information on soil moisture can be utilized for crop output
          predictions, irrigation scheduling, drought early warning, and
          reservoir management.
        </li>
        <li>
          More data on soil temperature and moisture can combat climate change
          by improving crop health and output while boosting farmers profits.

      <h1>APPLICABILITY</h1>
      <p class="applicability-text">
        Going forward, data on soil quality such as moisture and temperature can
        play a big part in combating climate change and landscape degradation.
        If properly maintained soil stores carbon, lowering greenhouse gas
        emissions in the atmosphere. If soils are poorly maintained or
        cultivated using unsustainable agricultural methods, soil carbon may be
        released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, which can further
        climate change, negatively impacting the environment and farmers alike.
